TITLE:	 generated dataset for simple Y-X no random effects

montecarlo:
		names are y x w;
		nobservations = 1000;
		ncsizes = 1;
		csizes = 100 (10);
		seed = 42;
		nreps = 2;
!		within = x;
		between = w;
		REPSAVE = ALL; SAVE = example1drep*.dat;

ANALYSIS:  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
ESTIMATOR = BAYES; !FBITER = 800;

model population:
%within%
! variances of exogenous variables
x@0.5;
! (residual) variances of endogenous variables
y*0.5;
! mediation with random parameters
!scprime | y on x;
sc | y ON x;

%between%
! exogenous: variances and means
[x@2]; x*1; 
! endogenous: residual vareiances and intercepts
[y*3]; y*0.4; 
! variances of random slopes/effects
sc*.5;
! intercepts of random slopes
[sc*-0.20] (mc);
y with sc*.0;


! between-level mediation effects
y on x*0.3;

! direct effect of moderator
y ON w*0.2;
! cross-level interaction for sa (first stage mediation)
[w*3]; w*1;
