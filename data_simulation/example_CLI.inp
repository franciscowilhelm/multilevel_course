TITLE:	 generated dataset for 1-1-1 multilevel mediation 
	with cross-level interaction, no random cov. structure

montecarlo:
		names are y x w;
		nobservations = 1000;
		ncsizes = 1;
		csizes = 100 (10);
		seed = 42;
		nreps = 2;
!		within = x;
		between = w;
		REPSAVE = ALL; SAVE = example_cli*.dat;
		PATMISS = y (.2) | y (.5) | y (.1)';
		PATPROBS = .5 | .2 | .3;

ANALYSIS:  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
ESTIMATOR = BAYES; FBITER = 800;

model population:
